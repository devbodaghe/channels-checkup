          Checking in on your family, friends and colleagues is always
          important. But during the coronavirus outbreak this will be more
          important than ever.

          Lots of us are feeling worried about the ongoing coronavirus
          outbreak.<br />
          While the focus is often on physical health, it's important to
          remember the impact on our mental health too.<br />
          You don't need to be an expert on mental health to be there for
          someone. Think about using these three tips:
        </p>
        <p><strong>1) Check in</strong></p>
        <p>
          You might not be able to meet face-to-face, but picking up the phone,
          having a video call, starting a group chat or messaging someone on
          social media lets them know you are there to talk and ready to listen.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2) Listen and reflect</strong></p>
        <p>
          Whether you have a mental health problem or not, this will be a
          challenging time for our mental health and wellbeing.&nbsp;<br />
          If someone opens up to you, remember that you don't need to fix things
          or offer advice. Often just listening, and showing you take them
          seriously, can help someone to manage.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3) Ask questions &nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ask how people are managing, and ask again if you're worried they
          aren't sharing the full picture. Asking again, with interest, can help
          someone to open up and explore what they're feeling.
        </p>
